# Aid Wave- A Donation Website for Those in Need

This README provides an overview of the core features and functionality of our donation website. The website aims to facilitate donations in various categories, such as Health, Education, Clothing, and Food, with a user-friendly interface and tracking system.

## Features

- The home page provides a search bar where users can search for donation cards by category. Initially, all 12 donation cards are displayed.

- Users can navigate to the Donation Page, where they find four categories: Food, Health, Clothing, and Education.

- Clicking on a category opens a dynamic page displaying donation cards within that category. Each card includes a button for making donations.

- Users can add multiple donations to their cart by clicking the "Add to Cart" button on the card. This allows for multiple donations within the same category.

- The Statistics Page presents a pie chart that visually represents donation percentages in two key categories one is the percentage of total donations and another is the percentage of users donation.
